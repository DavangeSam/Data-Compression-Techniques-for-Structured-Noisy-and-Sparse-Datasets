# Data-Compression-Techniques-for-Structured-Noisy-and-Sparse-Datasets

This project explores and compares different dimensionality reduction methods on three types of datasets. Each dataset consists of a table with N samples (tuples) and k features (attributes), effectively forming a set of N k-dimensional vectors.
🗃️ Datasets:

Table 1: Dense dataset representing a structured image.

![Table 1](https://github.com/DavangeSam/Data-Compression-Techniques-for-Structured-Noisy-and-Sparse-Datasets/blob/main/Table%201.png?raw=true)

Table 2: Dense dataset composed of randomly generated noise.

![Table 2](https://github.com/DavangeSam/Data-Compression-Techniques-for-Structured-Noisy-and-Sparse-Datasets/blob/main/Table%202.png?raw=true)

Table 3: Sparse dataset with limited non-zero entries. 



🛠️ Implemented Methods:

    PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

    DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)

    UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

Each method is applied to all three datasets, and the resulting reduced dimensionalities are reported and analyzed.
